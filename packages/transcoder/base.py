    # a version ends up `failed`. A ladder that comes out short is worth reading
    # again -- a dropped read, an object the store had not finished assembling --

    # stored as whatever it produced: the master is the irreplaceable half, the
    # reaper deletes the master of a `failed` version, and no measurement is
    # worth that trade. So the check refuses while a retry is left and accepts
    # with a loud log line when none is.
    #
    # Not quite absolute, and the gap is worth knowing: if the broker will not
    # take the retry message, `process_asset` records the failure at the first
    # attempt instead of rescheduling. That path is older than this flag and
    # applies to every exception a transcode can raise -- but this is the first
    # one an intact upload can produce, so the two now coincide.
